It is demo app which should have same features that standart ocamlbrowser
based on Tcl/Tk does have. But main purpose of this app is to test
*creating apps using OCaml and QML*!

Known problems:
* We using function Printtyp.signature to geenrate description for the item.
  But sometimes it generates empty string. Not idea why.

* If we execute `./QOcamlbrowser -I ocaml` and then we select Asdf module
we can see three items called `asdf`. Clicking by one of them raises OCaml 
exception: `Assert_failure("typing/printtyp.ml", 826, 6)`. Not idea why yet.
But in standart OCaml browser exists only one item for `asdf`.
